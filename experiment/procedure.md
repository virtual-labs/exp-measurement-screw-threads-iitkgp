1. First click on 'Two-wire' under 'Experiment Parts'. Click on the one wire for two times to place the two wires on the measuring faces of micrometer spindle and anvil.

2. Click on the screw thread specimen to place it in between the two wires on the measuring faces of micrometer spindle and anvil. Click on the left side arrow key on the 'Rotate Micrometer' button. Wait until the circular scale of the micrometer stops rotating. Again click on the same arrow key. Click it until the screw thread is properly fixed between the wires. One alert message will be shown when it is properly fixed. 

3. Click on 'Calculate' button to find out the values of the distance between the outer surfaces of the two wires ( M (mm)) and the effective diameter ( E (mm)). Click on the right side arrow key on the 'Rotate Micrometer' button two to three times to move the micrometer spindle from fixed position.

4. Click on the screw thread specimen to place it back to its previous position. Click on 'Clear' button.

5. Now click on 'Three-wire' under 'Experiment Parts'. Click on the one wire and two wire to place them on
the measuring faces of micrometer spindle and anvil.

6. Follow steps 2-4 to measure the distance between the outer surfaces of the three wires ( M (mm)), the effective diameter ( E (mm)) and the value of H ( height of the threads in mm ).
